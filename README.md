## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd cdp-example-node-frontend
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Updating dependencies

To update dependencies, globally install https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates. Then run the below script,
run tests, test the application and commit the altered `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. For more
options around updates check the package docs.

```bash
ncu -i
```

### AWS CLI

- Install the AWS CLI https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
- And add to your `.aws/credentials`

```bash
[localstack]
aws_access_key_id = test
aws_secret_access_key = test
```

### LocalStack

Either run _localstack_ directly via _docker_ and _AWS CLI_, or via the _localstack CLI_.

#### Docker

- Run AWS LocalStack Docker container:

```bash
docker run --pull=always -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack:latest
```

Note the exposed endpoint is `http://localhost:4566`

### Localstack CLI

- Install [LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)
- Run the CLI

```
localstack start
```

Note the exposed endpoint is `https://localhost:4566`

### Local JSON API

Whilst the APIs are being developed this app uses a local JSON mock API. To start this locally run:

```bash
npm run mockApi
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag cdp-example-node-frontend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 cdp-example-node-frontend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag cdp-example-node-frontend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 cdp-example-node-frontend
```
